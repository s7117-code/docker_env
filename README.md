# docker_ubuntu_env
A simple Dockerfile for an Ubuntu 20.04 development environment. Portable for use with classes and projects. Also useful as an experimental sandbox.

As of now these environments are only on Ubuntu but in theory should be able to be ported to other distros by changing the `FROM` at the beginning of the Dockerfile.

## Environments
- [ubuntu_env](base/)
- [ubuntu_env_cuda](cuda/)
